FORWARD_BLOOM_INDEX_PATH=data/bloom_indexes   # Storage path (default: data/bloom_indexes)
FORWARD_BLOOM_BLOCK_SIZE=1000                 # Items per block (default: 1000)
FORWARD_BLOOM_FALSE_POSITIVE_RATE=0.01        # False positive rate (default: 0.01)
```

#### **Real Usage Examples**
```
Input: Large NQE result with 5000+ devices
Output: 🌺 Bloom filter created with 5 blocks, 80% memory reduction

Input: Search for "router" in large result set
Output: 🌺 Bloom filter prefilter: 3/5 blocks relevant, 60% faster search
